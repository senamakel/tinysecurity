//! Scored prompt screening (contract 1.22).
//!
//! `ScanPrompt` answers a coarse verdict. `ScanPrompt2` answers what a host needs to
//! decide how much friction a prompt deserves: an additive score in thousandths, the
//! `Allow`, `Review` or `Block` tier it falls in and the content-free rule codes that
//! contributed, in detection order. The module owns the rules, the weights and the
//! thresholds; the host only maps a tier to its own handling. A tier is context and
//! never authorizes execution.
